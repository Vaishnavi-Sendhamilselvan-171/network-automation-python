# Network Automation with Python and Netmiko

This project automates the configuration of Cisco routers and switches using Python and Netmiko.

## Features
- SSH into multiple devices
- Push configuration commands like hostname, banner, and interface IPs
- Simple and scalable for labs or production

## How to Use
1. Add device IPs and credentials to device_list.txt
2. Add your config commands to config_commands.txt
3. Run the script with:
```bash
python automate_config.py

This uses triple backticks (``) with `bash to format the command nicely.
